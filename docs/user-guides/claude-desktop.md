have over 80% adherence, and are currently on a strength program"
```

```

## üìö Best Practices

### Effective Queries

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Be specific about what you want
- Include relevant context
- Use client names or IDs when known
- Ask for clarification if needed

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Use vague requests like "show everything"
- Include sensitive information in queries
- Assume Claude knows previous sessions

### Performance Tips

1. **Use filters** to limit result sets
2. **Request summaries** instead of full data
3. **Cache frequent queries** mentally
4. **Batch related requests** together

## üéØ Use Cases
